# This_is_KNN

KNN stores the entire training dataset which it uses as its representation. KNN does not learn any model. KNN makes predictions just-in-time by calculating the similarity between an input sample and each training instance. There are many distance measures to choose from to match the structure of your input data. That it is a good idea to rescale your data, such as using normalization, when using KNN.
